# Personal-Website
These are the files for my personal website! This site was originally a portfolio project for class, though I intend to improve and expand the site.

# Tools
This site was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Future Plans
I'm currently using this site as my personal site, so I plan to add more projects and improve functionality as I grow my skills.
